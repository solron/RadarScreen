# Radar Display

A application made in Unity as a radar screen to display objects detected by a Arduino Radar. Not a real radar since its using the HC-04 ultra sound range detector.
Objects found with the radar are displayed on the radar screen with the correct angle and distance.<br>

The Radar Display is listening for UDP packets on port 5000 (by default) sent by the Arduino Radar. The radar is not finished yet. So for the moments it is just simulated
by the RadarSim included in this folder.<br>
